# 3D-Printing
This is a collection of my designs relating to physical security and infosec.
These designs are the results of an evaluation of 3D Printing and its applications for security industry.
All designs are open source, and I encourage collaboration by providing the raw files which can be easily edited or transformed to fit your needs.
I intend to create a 3D Printing 101 guide geared towards those in the security industry in an effort to get more involved and provide resources to those with no experience with 3D Printing.

# Linear Master Key
This is the master key to Linear Access Control devices, now rebranded as Nortek. Linear devices secure a large percentage of residential and commercial facilities across the US.
This master key has been recreated from measurements taken from a key purchased from an online distributor of access control products.
Because I do not have the bitting code for this key, and because the cuts are tinier than calipers can fit into, the key is not an exact replica. 
This key has been tested and reliably works on models such as the AE-100, AE-500, AE-2000, and more.

# Strike Plate Plug
Designed to be adaptable to various strike plate form factors, the plate plug provides a superior solution for persistent access compared to current latch-disabling techniques.
Various grooves are designed to accommodate common obtrusions, while allowing the option to be flipped vertically and used to adapt to rounded or square housings.
Additional plates allow the operator to adjust the tool to various lengths, expanding the plug to the size of the strike plate, and consequently prevents the latch from locking the door shut.
The adjustment plates are designed to separate horizontally, allowing the operator to place the tool, select the appropriate length, and remove excess plates horizontally - all in a swift movement as one passes through the doorway.

# Triple Threat
Haven't come up with a real name for this yet.
The Triple Threat is a simple solution to an infuriating problem - organization of padlock shims, bypass tools, and picks which need to be accessed quickly.
Padlock shims are an excellent tool which I find in exceedingly short supply - likely due to their tendency to jump out of pockets as they snag on other tools. 
The Triple Threat provides a means to carry shims in an organized fashion, as well as a pair of bogota picks and two bypass tools (Quickstik and 175 Bypass).
As much as I love to support Sparrows, Core, SEREPick, etc, hopefully this tool can help others prevent loss of common tools while also provided a reliable means to access them when seconds count. 

# Six Slot Shim Sheath
Same concept as the Triple Threat, meant to house padlock shims in an organized fashion designed to prevent tragic operator + tool separation. 
No pick or bypass compartments on this one, just the shim holster.
